# 📊 End-to-End Machine Learning Project on Student Performance Index

This repository presents a complete **End-to-End Machine Learning pipeline** to predict and analyze a **Student Performance Index (SPI)**. It includes data preprocessing, EDA, model building, evaluation, tuning, and deployment using Flask.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates student performance based on various academic, demographic, and lifestyle features. This project covers:

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature Engineering & Selection  
- Model Training and Evaluation  
- Hyperparameter Tuning  
- Model Deployment with Flask Web App
